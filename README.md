# UdpMobileApp
This app was my first version of implementing recording voice for [Drone Speech](https://github.com/Asthera/Drone-Speech/tree/main) project.
## Problem
I decide to not use this app because it had transmission losses(maybe because of transmision in bytes so need to have time for encode/decode), so i use microphone directly from my mac.
