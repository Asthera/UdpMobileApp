# UdpMobileApp
This app was my first version of implementing recording voice for [Drone Speech](https://github.com/Asthera/Drone-Speech/tree/main) project.
## Problem
I decide to not use this app because it had transmission losses(maybe because of transmision in bytes so need to have time for encode/decode), so i use microphone directly from my mac.
## What you need ?
Of course you need to run server on ypur machine, and then insert **IP** and **Port** to this app for starting streaming.
